    "# The SDC Reference Implementation (RI)\n",
    "The [SDC Reference Implementation](https://sdt.cap.org/SDCApp/Index.aspx) is hosted by the CAP for testing of SDC Forms. Anyone can request a connection to the SDC Reference Implementation to test their own application's handling of the forms by contacting the administrators at CAPeCC@cap.org. The RI contains the 3 core components outlined in the SDC Specification: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Form Manager\n",
    "* Form Filler\n",
    "* Form Receiver \n",
    "\n",
    "After launching SDC Reference Implementation in the browser, users will be presented with the SDC home page.\n",
    "SDC home page includes various options at the right hand side top mentioned here\n",
    "1. Form Manager – Lists all the available packages and Option to upload new SDC forms.\n",
    "2. Form Filler – Request SDC forms from authorized Form Manager in the specific content format with an option to send form to more than one form receiver.\n",
    "3. Form Receiver – Receives form and displays submitted content of the received form.\n",
    "4. Configuration – This option supports adding new form mangers and form receivers.\n",
    "5. Transaction Log – Displays all the transactions that occurred between various actors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction has more details on these actors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CAP SDC Reference Implementation is a web-based tool that enables users to request an SDC form from the CAP Form Manager repository. Form Fillers have the capability to request available SDC packages in various formats like XML, HTML, and URI from the registered and authorized Form Manager. The Form Manager processes these requests and subsequently delivers the requested SDC form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once retrieved, the Form Filler inputs the necessary data and submits the form response to the Form Receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can send comments, questions, or feedback to CAPeCC@cap.org\n",
    "\n",
    "### Login \n",
    "You can login to the RI with an official CAP account or any Google account.\n",
    "![Login Screen](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_Login.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First Time Login \n",
    "The first time you log in you'll have to submit a form to confirm who you are. This data is collected in accordance with ONC recommendations for reference implementations. \n",
    "![First Time Login](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FirstTimeLogin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical RI Testing Workflow: \n",
    "1. The Form Filler can request available SDC packages in various formats such as XML, HTML and URI from the registered/authorized Form Manager.\n",
    "2. The Form Manager will process the request and returns the requested SDC form.\n",
    "3. The Form Filler will input the data and submit the form response to the Form Receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Form Manager\n",
    "CAP Form Manager displays all the available Packages with the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Package Id – Package Identifier (CAP prefixes all the packages with PKG_***)\n",
    "* Package Name – Name of the Package\n",
    "* Form Id - Name of the form Id (Ckey for eCC SDC forms)\n",
    "* Form Name – Name of the SDC form\n",
    "* Default Submission Endpoints registered with the package\n",
    "* Date Uploaded- Displays when form was registered with the form manager\n",
    "* Validation Path – SDC schema version\n",
    "\n",
    "Note-SDC and the CAP eCPs has gone through various phases and hence different versions are available, it is recommended that you use the latest versions, unless legacy support is required.\n",
    "![Form Manager Main Screen](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uploading A new Form\n",
    "Users can upload a new form by clicking \"Upload a New Package\" which will take you to the Upload New SDC Package Screen. \n",
    "![Upload a Form](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FM-Upload-A-Form.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When uploading a form, the PackageID, PackageName, AgencyName (author), where it can be submitted, the validation path, and transform path must be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PackageID, PackageName, AgencyName (author) can all be pulled from the metadata of the form. \n",
    "\n",
    "The selected submit endpoints should be picked upon upload, these represent the different Form Receivers expected to receive your form. If you're not sure which ones you'll be submitting to, it's recommended to select all using SHIFT and clicking the top and bottom ones. You can also pick multiple individual ones by using CTRL + Click to select each individual Form Receiver. FHIR Form Receivers will be flagged as \"FHIR_[FormReceiver Name].\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Validation Path contains different versions of the schema for checking the structure of the form. It's recommended to us the latest version, which are typically dated by year, e.g. schema/2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Transform Path represents the XSLT that will be used to render the form. Using an incorrect XSLT can result in errors in how the form is visually displayed in the Reference Implementation. \n",
    "\n",
