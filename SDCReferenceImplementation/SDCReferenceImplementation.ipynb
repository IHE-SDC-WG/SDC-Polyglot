    "# The SDC Reference Implementation (RI)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [SDC Reference Implementation](https://sdt.cap.org/SDCApp/Index.aspx) is hosted by the CAP for testing of SDC Forms. To begin testing, anyone with a Google Account, can request a connection to the SDC Reference Implementation to test their own application's handling of the forms by contacting the administrators at CancerProtocols@cap.org. The RI contains the 3 core components or 'actors' outlined in the SDC Specification: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Form Manager\n",
    "* Form Filler\n",
    "* Form Receiver \n",
    "\n",
    "After launching SDC Reference Implementation in the browser, users will be presented with the SDC home page.\n",
    "SDC home page includes various options at the right hand side top mentioned here\n",
    "0. **Home** - the Main Page with Links to Relevant SDC material including the [SDC Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/ihe.net/forum/?pli=1#!forum/sdc), and GitHub [GitHub](https://github.com/IHE-SDC-WG).\n",
    "1. **Form Manager** – Lists all the available packages and Option to upload new SDC forms.\n",
    "2. **Form Filler** – Request SDC forms from authorized Form Manager in the specific content format with an option to send form to more than one form receiver.\n",
    "3. **Form Receiver** – Receives form and displays submitted content of the received form.\n",
    "4. **Configuration** – This option supports adding new form managers and form receivers.\n",
    "5. **Transaction Log** – Displays all the transactions that occurred between various actors. \n",
    "\n",
    "To elaborate more on the **Home** page, beyond the short description given above, there are the following sections on the page:\n",
    "Conference Calls - a Google calendar of conference calls/ meetings discussing the IHE SDC. It initially displays content by month.\n",
    "Resources - this includes the previously mentioned **Google Group** and **Github** and also:\n",
    "- **Wiki Page** - this is the IHE SDC wiki\n",
    "- **Slack** - this is the structureddatacapture slack group\n",
    "- **System manual** - this is the original SDC RI document for use of the RI (authored in 2018 at the CAP), this section of the SDC Polyglot notebook serves as the updated version\n",
    "- **Technical Reference Guide** (TRG) - this document is an earlier version of the IHE SDC structure; it has a strong focus on the CAP eCPs\n",
    "- **Contact** - email the cancer protocols team at the CAP\n",
    "- **About** - Contains a very short summary of the SDC RI\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Sections of the RI](RI_Header.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Introduction notebook has more details on these actors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CAP SDC Reference Implementation is a web-based tool that enables users to request an SDC form from the CAP Form Manager repository. Form Fillers have the capability to request available SDC packages in various formats like XML, HTML, and URI from the registered and authorized Form Manager. The [IHE SDC Supplement](https://ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/QRPH/IHE_QRPH_Suppl_SDC.pdf) offers some details on these different methods for form retrieval in Section X.2 SDC Actor Options. The Form Manager processes these requests and subsequently (then? less pol) delivers the requested SDC form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once retrieved, the user uses the Form Filler to input the necessary data and submits the form response to the Form Receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can send comments, questions, or feedback to CancerProtocols@cap.org\n",
    "\n",
    "### Login \n",
    "\n",
    "You can login to the RI with an official CAP account or any Google account.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Login Screen](RI_Login.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the site has a very short time out, at which point it'll prompt you to log in again. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the top right your email address will be displayed, along with Help and Logout. Help brings up the pdf system manual, and Logout will end your session and return you to the login page. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### First Time Login \n",
    "\n",
    "The first time you log in you'll have to submit a form to confirm who you are. This data is collected in accordance with ONC recommendations for reference implementations. \n",
    "\n",
    "![First Time Login](RI_FirstTimeLogin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical RI Testing Workflow: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Form Filler can request available SDC packages in various formats such as XML, HTML and URI from the registered/authorized Form Manager.\n",
    "2. The Form Manager will process the request and returns the requested SDC form.\n",
    "3. The Form Filler will input the data and submit the form response to the Form Receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Form Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "CAP Form Manager displays all the available Packages with the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Package Id: Package Identifier (CAP prefixes all the packages with PKG_***)\n",
    "* Package Name: Name of the Package\n",
    "* Form Id: Name of the form Id (Ckey for eCC SDC forms)\n",
    "* Form Name: Name of the SDC form\n",
    "* Agency Name: Name of the authoring agency of the form\n",
    "* Validation Path: SDC schema version\n",
    "* Transformation Path: A Working or version4 of the Schema, can be selected upon Form upload/update\n",
    "* Date Updated: Displays when form was registered with the form manager\n",
    "* Files: both XML and HTML versions of the form\n",
    "* Actions: Update or Remove the form from the Form Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "Note- SDC and the CAP eCPs has gone through various phases and hence different versions are available, it is recommended that you use the latest versions, unless legacy support is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Form Manager Main Screen](RI_FM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uploading A new Form\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can upload a new form by clicking \"Upload a New Package\" which will take you to the Upload New SDC Package Screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Upload a Form](RI_FM-Upload-A-Form.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When uploading a form, the PackageID, PackageName, AgencyName (author), where it can be submitted, the validation path, and transform path must be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PackageID, PackageName, AgencyName (author) can all be pulled from the metadata of the form. It is recommended you copy these values out of the form, (as well as?) or add them to the form if they are not already present in the header.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected submit endpoints should be picked upon upload, these represent the different Form Receivers expected to receive your form. If you're not sure which ones you'll be submitting to, it's recommended to select all using SHIFT and clicking the top and bottom ones. You can also pick multiple individual ones by using CTRL + Click to select each individual Form Receiver. FHIR Form Receivers will be flagged as \"FHIR_[FormReceiver Name]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Validation Path contains different versions of the schema for checking the structure of the form. It's recommended to use the latest version, which are typically dated by year, e.g., schema/2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Transform Path represents the XSLT that will be used to render the form. Using an incorrect XSLT can result in errors in how the form is visually displayed in the Reference Implementation. It is recommended to use the \"Working\" version, though legacy versions can be used which are titled Ver#, e.g. Ver4. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Reference Implementation will provide an error if any fields are missing. All fields on the Upload screen are required and marked by a * to indicate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once uploaded the form will appear in the Form Manager for anyone to test with. A form can be adjusted using the \"Update\" button, which allows you to change the properties above, copy and paste a new version of the form in, or change individual lines. A form can be deleted by anyone using the \"Remove\" button. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also view the XML or HTML version of the form using the respective buttons. When viewing the forms from the Form Manager you can fill them out for testing form functionality, but cannot submit them to a Form Receiver. Testing Form submission must be done from the Form Filler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Form Filler\n",
    "\n",
    "The Form Fillers can be selected from the drop down menu in the top bar. \n",
    "\n",
    "![FF Selection](RI_FF-Select.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAP FF is the default at the top of the list. This guide will only cover use of the CAP FF. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the CAP FF loads, you will need to select your package.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Select your form](RI_FF-formSelect.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selecting A Form\n",
    "\n",
    "A Content Format can be selected: \n",
    "\n",
    "* XML\n",
    "* HTML\n",
    "* URL\n",
    "\n",
    "All types are functionally the same, but behind the scenes they convey the different ways an FF can receive a form. The [IHE SDC Supplement](https://ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/QRPH/IHE_QRPH_Suppl_SDC.pdf) offers some details on these different methods for form retrieval in Section X.2 SDC Actor Options.\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting the form and the Content Format, the user should pick the Form Receiver(s) they wish to submit to. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Select Form Receivers](RI_FF-SelectFR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, FHIR Form Receivers are identified by \"FHIR_[Form Receiver Name].\" Other endpoints are SDC RFD endpoints as specified in the aforementioned [IHE SDC Supplement](https://ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/QRPH/IHE_QRPH_Suppl_SDC.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can also load a set of pre-pop data as an option also detailed in the [IHE SDC Supplement](https://ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/QRPH/IHE_QRPH_Suppl_SDC.pdf) section X.4.1.1 and Q.1. This provides a set of data for the Form Manager to fill in before it's pulled by the Form Filler. This feature is designed to save users time filling already existing data. Anything in the SDC form could be prepopulated wih data from an external source such as FHIR resources, CCDA documents, or other SDC forms. This feature has not been widely used and is use case dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples below show a FHIR Patient Resource, which could be used to prepopulate an SDC form by mapping the data elements together. In future iterations of this guide, examples on how to create a prepopulation service will be added."
