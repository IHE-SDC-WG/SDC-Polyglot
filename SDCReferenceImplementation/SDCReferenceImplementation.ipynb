    "# The SDC Reference Implementation (RI)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [SDC Reference Implementation](https://sdt.cap.org/SDCApp/Index.aspx) is hosted by the CAP for testing of SDC Forms. Anyone can request a connection to the SDC Reference Implementation to test their own application's handling of the forms by contacting the administrators at CAPeCC@cap.org. The RI contains the 3 core components outlined in the SDC Specification: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Form Manager\n",
    "* Form Filler\n",
    "* Form Receiver \n",
    "\n",
    "After launching SDC Reference Implementation in the browser, users will be presented with the SDC home page.\n",
    "SDC home page includes various options at the right hand side top mentioned here\n",
    "0. Home - the Main Page with Links to Relevant SDC material including the [SDC Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/ihe.net/forum/?pli=1#!forum/sdc), and GitHub [GitHub](https://github.com/IHE-SDC-WG).\n",
    "1. Form Manager – Lists all the available packages and Option to upload new SDC forms.\n",
    "2. Form Filler – Request SDC forms from authorized Form Manager in the specific content format with an option to send form to more than one form receiver.\n",
    "3. Form Receiver – Receives form and displays submitted content of the received form.\n",
    "4. Configuration – This option supports adding new form mangers and form receivers.\n",
    "5. Transaction Log – Displays all the transactions that occurred between various actors. \n",
    "\n",
    "![The Sections of the RI](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_Header.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction has more details on these actors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CAP SDC Reference Implementation is a web-based tool that enables users to request an SDC form from the CAP Form Manager repository. Form Fillers have the capability to request available SDC packages in various formats like XML, HTML, and URI from the registered and authorized Form Manager. The [IHE SDC Supplement](https://ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/QRPH/IHE_QRPH_Suppl_SDC.pdf) offers some details on these different methods for form retrieval in Section X.2 SDC Actor Options. The Form Manager processes these requests and subsequently delivers the requested SDC form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once retrieved, the user uses the Form Filler to input the necessary data and submits the form response to the Form Receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can send comments, questions, or feedback to CAPeCC@cap.org\n",
    "\n",
    "### Login \n",
    "\n",
    "You can login to the RI with an official CAP account or any Google account.\n",
    "![Login Screen](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_Login.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the site has a very short time out, at which point it'll prompt you to log in again. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the top right your email address will be displayed, along with Help and Logout. Help brings up the pdf system manual, and Logout will end your session and return you to the login page. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### First Time Login \n",
    "\n",
    "The first time you log in you'll have to submit a form to confirm who you are. This data is collected in accordance with ONC recommendations for reference implementations. \n",
    "![First Time Login](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FirstTimeLogin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical RI Testing Workflow: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Form Filler can request available SDC packages in various formats such as XML, HTML and URI from the registered/authorized Form Manager.\n",
    "2. The Form Manager will process the request and returns the requested SDC form.\n",
    "3. The Form Filler will input the data and submit the form response to the Form Receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Form Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "CAP Form Manager displays all the available Packages with the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Package Id – Package Identifier (CAP prefixes all the packages with PKG_***)\n",
    "* Package Name – Name of the Package\n",
    "* Form Id - Name of the form Id (Ckey for eCC SDC forms)\n",
    "* Form Name – Name of the SDC form\n",
    "* Default Submission Endpoints registered with the package\n",
    "* Date Uploaded- Displays when form was registered with the form manager\n",
    "* Validation Path – SDC schema version\n",
    "\n",
    "Note-SDC and the CAP eCPs has gone through various phases and hence different versions are available, it is recommended that you use the latest versions, unless legacy support is required.\n",
    "![Form Manager Main Screen](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uploading A new Form\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can upload a new form by clicking \"Upload a New Package\" which will take you to the Upload New SDC Package Screen. \n",
    "![Upload a Form](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FM-Upload-A-Form.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When uploading a form, the PackageID, PackageName, AgencyName (author), where it can be submitted, the validation path, and transform path must be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PackageID, PackageName, AgencyName (author) can all be pulled from the metadata of the form. It is recommended you copy these values out of the form, or add them to the form if they are not already present in the header.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected submit endpoints should be picked upon upload, these represent the different Form Receivers expected to receive your form. If you're not sure which ones you'll be submitting to, it's recommended to select all using SHIFT and clicking the top and bottom ones. You can also pick multiple individual ones by using CTRL + Click to select each individual Form Receiver. FHIR Form Receivers will be flagged as \"FHIR_[FormReceiver Name]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Validation Path contains different versions of the schema for checking the structure of the form. It's recommended to us the latest version, which are typically dated by year, e.g. schema/2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Transform Path represents the XSLT that will be used to render the form. Using an incorrect XSLT can result in errors in how the form is visually displayed in the Reference Implementation. It is recommended to use the \"Working\" version, though legacy versions can be used which are titled Ver#, e.g. Ver4. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Reference Implementation will provide an error if any fields are missing. All fields on the Upload screen are required and marked by a * to indicate so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once uploaded the form will appear in the Form Manager for anyone to test with. A form can be adjusted using the \"Update\" button, which allows you to change the properties above, copy and paste a new version of the form in, or change individual lines. A form can be deleted by anyone using the \"Remove\" button. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also view the XML or HTML version of the form using the respective buttons. When viewing the forms from the Form Manager you cannot test or submit them to a Form Receiver. That must be done from the Form Manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Form Filler\n",
    "\n",
    "The Form Fillers can be selected from the drop down menu in the top bar. \n",
    "![FF Selection](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FF-Select.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAP FF is the default at the top of the list. This guide will only cover use of the CAP FF. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the CAP FF loads, you will need to select your package.\n",
    "![Select your form](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FF-formSelect.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Selecting A Form\n",
    "\n",
    "A Content Format can be selected: \n",
    "\n",
    "* XML\n",
    "* HTML\n",
    "* URL\n",
    "\n",
    "All types are functionally the same, but behind the scenes they convey the different ways an FF can receive a form. The [IHE SDC Supplement](https://ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/QRPH/IHE_QRPH_Suppl_SDC.pdf) offers some details on these different methods for form retrieval in Section X.2 SDC Actor Options.\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting the form and the Content Format, the user should pick the Form Receiver(s) they wish to submit to. \n",
    "![Select Form Receivers](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FF-SelectFR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, FHIR Form Recievers are identified by \"FHIR_[Form Receiver Name]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can also load a set of pre-pop data as an option also detailed in the [IHE SDC Supplement](https://ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/QRPH/IHE_QRPH_Suppl_SDC.pdf) section X.4.1.1. This provides a set of data for the Form Manager to fill in before it's pulled by the Form Filler. This feature is designed to save users time filling already existing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filling and Submitting a Form\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon loading the selected form a user can fill it out and submit it for testing. \n",
    "![Form Filler view](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FF-FormFill.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "The form should be filled folowing all the rules, and different metadata can be toggled on and off using the menus at the top of the form. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the desired test data has been filled in the user should click submit at the bottom, to send the form to the desired form fillers. \n",
    "![Form Filler Submit](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FF-Submit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submit Confirmation\n",
    "\n",
    "With the form sent to the Form Receiver, the FF will generate a flat file. \n",
    "![Flat File](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FF-FlatFile.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Form Receiver will confirm to the FF that the form was received. \n",
    "\n",
    "Confirmation messages for RFD form Receivers, the default as specified in the [IHE SDC Supplement](https://ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/QRPH/IHE_QRPH_Suppl_SDC.pdf), will look like the screenshot below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![FR Confirms Form Received](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FF_RFDSubmitSuccess.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "FHIR Form Receivers will provide a link to the created FHIR bundle. \n",
    "![FR Confirmed Form Received FHIR](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FF-FHIRSubmitSuccess.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors in the form may also be displayed in the yellow box and can be reviewed in the Transaction Log. Errors can be issues like incorrect data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Form Receiver\n",
    "\n",
    "The Form Receiver shows all the forms submitted by the form Filler along with some metadata including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transaction ID\n",
    "* Submit time\n",
    "* Form ID\n",
    "* Form Name\n",
    "* Source - IP Address\n",
    "* Valid - True/False\n",
    "* Message - valid or the errors \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also search for data in any of the fields above in order to find exact forms you're looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Form Receiver](SDCReferenceImplementation/RI_FR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a test application, the Form Receiver will still accept incorrect data, but flag it as Valid = False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can also View XML or View HTML to look at the raw form, or a transformed form for human readability. This is useful to confirm that the data sent by the Form Filler, matches what was received in case there were any errors in transit. The form can also be removed, if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAP Form Receiver does not support receiving FHIR messages, it exclusively supports RFD as outlined in the [IHE SDC Supplement](https://ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/QRPH/IHE_QRPH_Suppl_SDC.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration Page is only available to administrators. \n",
    "\n",
    "This page is where new systems can be added to the Reference Implementation for testing. If you would like to add your system please contact CAPeCC@cap.org\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction Log \n",
    "\n",
    "The Transaction log contains details of each actor. It tracks, forms uplaoded to the Form Manager, retrieved by the Form Filler, sent by the Form Filler, and received by the Form Receiver. \n",
    "\n",
    "A transaction may be viewed to see what was sent or received, or removed to delete it. "
