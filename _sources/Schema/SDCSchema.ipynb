    "## FormDesign\n",
    "\n",
    "The FDF root element (`FormDesign` or `DemogFormDesign`) has a relatively large number of attributes. Some of the attributes address static FDF metadata inserted by the FDF designer. These are related to the identity of the FDF, such as the ID or the filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "`DemogFormDesign` is typically only used when there are multiple forms in an `SDCPackage` and the first form contains only demographic data. Otherwise for other forms, even if multiple inside an `SDCPackage` will use `FormDesign` to wrap the form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other attributes have values that are used to track form instance data used for tracking individual instances of forms that are instantiated for a specific purpose, e.g., entering data on a specific patient, during a specific encounter. Instance values are assigned by the Form Manager (FM), Form Filler (FF), and/or Form Receiver (FR).\n",
    "\n",
    "For tracking purposes in some use cases, a Form Manager may assign some of instance identifiers before delivering an SDC form to the FF, and the FF must check for these pre-assigned instance-tracking values to avoid inappropriately overriding Form Manager-assigned values. In other cases, the instance tracking values are assigned by the FF, and included as part of the forms data set that is transmitted to the FR. If the FF detects that the Form has not assigned instance values to the instance attributes, then it may assign them itself. A FR should not alter the contents of a received FF form. However, a FR may log some or all of the instance attribute values in another data storage area, and may add its own logging information (e.g., time of receipt, hash value of XML contents, etc.), but these data should not be added to the FDF-R. In many cases, the FF is a “dumb” web page, and therefore performs none of the instance functions. In some cases, the FM and/or FF and/or FR may be part of the same institution, and this will help determine which actor(s) assign the instance values.\n",
    "\n",
    "All instance attributes are optional in the XML, because they are not relevant in empty (not-instance) forms. Some static attributes are also optional. A FR should check for the correct assignment of all `FormDesign` attribute values as part of the validation process of a received form.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third class of attributes are the instance status attributes. These are assigned by the FF based on information provided by the DEF user. The attributes address the type of changes in the DEF and finality of the submitted FDF-R.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FormDesign Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "The following subsections describe the different attributes that may be present in the <FormDesign/> element. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Static Attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Values for these attributes are supplied by the form designer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `formTitle`: Human readable title for display when choosing forms from list provided by a FM. The `formTitle` may be displayed at the top of the DEF.\n",
    "* `baseURI`: This parameter is required in the `FormDesign` element but is optional in the XFCs. It identifies the organization that is responsible for designing and maintaining the FDF or XFC. It's best to avoid using prefixes like \"Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.\" or \"Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.\" because these can occasionally cause XML validation errors when used in a URI-typed field.\n",
    "* `basedOnURI`: URI used to identify the SDC form that the current FDF is based upon. In most cases, this should be a standard SDC form that is modified and/or extended by the current FDF. It's best to avoid using prefixes like \"Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.\" or \"Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.\" because these can occasionally cause XML validation errors when used in a URI-typed field.\n",
    "* `lineage`: A string identifier that is used to group multiple versions of a single form. The lineage is constant for all versions of a single kind of form. When appended to `baseURI`, it can be used to retrieve all versions of one particular form. Example: lineage=\"Lung.Bmk.227\".\n",
    "* `version`: A string that contains the version text for the current form. It is designed to be used in conjunction with `baseURI` and `lineage`.\n",
    "* `ID`: In `FormDesign`, the ID is used to uniquely identify an \"empty\" FDF (i.e., not an FDF-R, which contains user-entered data) from other FDF files that have different FDF content. Thus, a `FormDesign` ID is shared by all FDFs that have the same lineage and version. To represent this concept, we create the ID with the following formula: ID=lineage_version_sdcFDF. In other words, we concatenate the components lineage, version, and the text \"sdcFDF\" using \"_\" characters as separators. The suffix \"sdcFDF\" indicates that we are working with the FDF variant, not the FDF-R or the DE variant of SDC XML. From Example 5: FormDesign attributes and Properties:\n",
    "  * ID=\"Lung.Bmk.227_1.001.011.RC1_sdcFDF\", we can clearly see how lineage and version values and the text \"sdcFDF\" are concatenated with \"_\".\n",
    "* `filename`: The filename of the FDF when is saved to a file storage device (e.g., a disk or USB drive). The filename appears inside the FDF XML to help ensure the identity of the FDF content in case the saved filename (on a disk drive, etc.) has been changed for any reason.\n",
    "  * For FDF files without responses, the filename, one suggested format is lineage_version_sdcFDF.xml.\n",
    "  * For assigning a filename to FDF-R instance documents, the following filename format may be considered: lineage_version_instance_instanceVersion_sdcFDFR.xml. `instance` is a GUID that identified the all versions of an instance FDF-R document. `instVer` is a version of the instance FDF-R. However, this format can become rather long, and thus short GUIDs or other formats may be considered.\n",
    "* `fullURI`: The full URI that uniquely identifies the current form. It is created by building up a REST-style query string from several components: `baseURI`, `lineage`, `version`, and `doctype`, using a format of component=value pairs, as in the following example:\n",
    "  * fullURI=\"_baseURI=cap.org&_lineage=Lung.Bmk.227&_version=1.001.011.RC1&_docType=sdcFDF\".\n",
    "  * Note that each bolded component name is preceded by an underscore \"_\" and most component names and values derive from a `FormDesign` attribute. The only `fullURI` component not present as an attribute in `FormDesign` is `docType`, which is always set to \"sdcFDF\" for FDFs, and is set to \"sdcFDFR\" for FDF-R documents, which contain data. Note that all \"&\" (ampersand) symbols are escaped using the standard XML/HTML \"&amp;\" escape notation.\n",
    "* `prevVersionURI`: This URI is used to identify the SDC form that is the immediate previous version of the current FDF. The format is the same as `fullURI`. The primary role of this optional attribute is to allow automated comparisons between a current FDF and the immediate previous FDF version. This is often helpful when deciding whether to adopt a newer version of an FDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instance Attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "These are attributes found in an FDF-R, which is created to contain user-entered data.  Included in brackets “[  ]” are the IHE actor(s) that are responsible for adding the correct value to each attribute.  Different use cases may redefine the requirements for each attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `formInstanceURI`: Unique URI used to identify a unique instance of an FDF that contains user responses. It is used for tracking form responses across time and across multiple episodes of editing by end-users. This instance identifier does not change for each edit session of a form instance. The formInstanceURI is formatted similarly to the fullURI but includes an additional parameter: _instance= {some GUID}. A GUID (e.g., a1b2c3d4…) should be used to create the unique instance part of the URI. An example is:"

    "![SDC Schema Hierarchy](Schema/SDCtypeHierarchy.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `BaseType`: \n",
    "* `CodeMatchType`:\n",
    "* `CommentType`:\n",
    "* `ExtensionType`: \n",
    "* `ExtensionBaseType`: (EBT) requires a more detailed explaination below.\n",

    "* `SectionType`:\n",
    "* `QuestionType`: \n",
    "\n",
    "### ExtensionBaseType (EBT)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ExtensionBaseType (EBT) is an abstract type that confers on descendants the ability to add custom `Extension`, `Comment` and `Property` elements. Most SDC Types inherit from ExtensionBaseType, with the notable exceptions of CommentType, ExtensionType, all SDC datatypes, and some direct derivatives of datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Extension` element provides a place to insert XML that is not defined in the SDC Schema. The `Extension` element is defined by `ExtensionType`, which inherits from `BaseType`. The sub-elements of `Extension` must provide a namespace (and ideally an XML Schema) for any non-SDC elements and attributes that are introduced.  The `Extension` element provides almost infinite expansion flexibility for SDC. However, it also requires that form designers and implementers agree on the supported extensions, agree on which elements and contexts they may be used, document this usage, and create an extension validation mechanism to enforce correct usage and detect incorrect usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comment\n",
    "\n",
    "The EBT also includes the ability to add optional `Comment` elements. The `Comment` element is defined by the `CommentType`, which inherits from `BaseType`.  Comments may be provided by the FDF designer, the FDF implementation code, or by the DEF user. The type and styling of the `Comment` (if present) can be customized with the `type` and `styleClass` attributes. The comments are simple ASCII text and may not include rich text or substructures. The `Comment` content is placed in the `val` attribute of the `Comment` element.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of comments created by an FDF designer are comments for the implementor. Comments from the DEF user might concern their response to a QR or the selection of a `ListItem`. If DEF users are allowed to add `Comment` elements, then the FDF implementation must include visual clues (e.g., a comment icon) in the DEF so that the user can add comments at appropriate points (e.g., on each `Question` and `ListItem`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Property\n",
    "\n",
    "`Property` elements are based on `PropertyType`.  `PropertyType`, which is a component of EBT, also derives recursively from EBT. Thus, a `Property` element may have any number of direct `Comment`, `Extension`, and `Property` descendants, and `Property` elements may thus be nested to any desired degree.  `Property` elements may occur as children of all XFCs and most other FDF elements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Properties may be used to define standard or custom FDF metadata.  They also may be used to record visible or hidden metadata for any purpose.   `Property` elements, when used on a DI or descendants of `DisplayedType`, can be used for many kinds of tasks including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Display static information on forms\n",
    "* Display context-sensitive information (e.g., tooltips, status bar text, help pop-ups, or special text designed for report output).   (The `Link` element may also be used to provide help resources)\n",
    "* Provide rich title text (i.e., in HTML format) for implementations that support rich text\n",
    "* Provide alternative language text\n",
    "* Provide ancillary, alternate, instructional or informational text for `DisplayedType` descendants\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, `Property`-derived text is displayed only under certain conditions (e.g., for rendering tooltips or report output).  Determining if/when a `Property` should be displayed on a DEF requires the interpretation of its `propName`, `type`, and `styleClass` attributes, as specified by an established user community.  Examples of possible `Property` `propName` values include “helpText,” “tooltip,” “statusBarText,” etc., which are commonly supported concepts and control types in most DEF programming frameworks.  The  `Property` element is also commonly used to contain invisible form metadata, e.g., versioning, source references, alternate language text, etc.  Examples include “alt-text,” “reportText,” “htmlTitle,” etc, which will be described later.  Any SDC `Property` text may optionally be available as strongly-typed data (e.g., integer, string, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "`Property` may have descendants of `Property`, `Comment`, and `Extension`.  As shown in Example 12: Nested Properties, `Properties` may be nested to any depth and use any datatype for the `Property’s` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Properties` will be called by their `propName`, so that if the `propName` value is “myPropName1,” the `Property` will be called the “myPropName1 Property.”  A `Property` must have content in the `propName` attribute, unless it is using a strongly-typed value under the `Property\\TypedValue` tag.   Strongly-typed `Property` values are discussed next.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Example 14 shows a strongly typed `Property` used to include XHTML-formatted text at any point in any EBT-derived element. The term “strongly-typed” in this context means that we are using a well-known (and preferably well-documented) `propName` value, which in this example is “myHtmlProperty”. Note the inclusion of a required XHTML Schema xmlns namespace declaration and SchemaLocation in the first <div> element. They are both required for the use and validation of a `Property` with strongly-typed XHTML content. As noted above, the HTML datatype element is used for this purpose, but the validation is accomplished with an XHTML Schema, to make it produce only valid XML, and make it work with strict XML validation technologies.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `ID`: The ubiquitous ID attribute is a unique URI identifier for XFC types in `FormDesign`, and for FormDesign itself. It is required, and its uniqueness is enforced by the SDC Schema. URI identifiers are very flexible since they may assume any legal XML URI format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `baseURI`: The baseURI is required only in the FormDesign element; it is optional on XFCs. It identifies the organization that is responsible for designing and maintaining the FDF or XFC. If an XFC does not derive from the same organization as the default baseURI (the FDF `baseURI` which is defined in the `FormDesign` element), then a new value for the baseURI is entered on the XFC element to override the default one, and the new baseURI is then inherited by all descendant XFCs unless overridden by a descendant XFC. In most cases, FDFs will contain only a single default baseURI on the FDF, and no baseURI on the XFCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the `baseURI` + `ID` should combine to form a globally unique identifier, that uniquely identifies an item in a particular form `lineage`.

DisplayedType defines most of the essential functional underlying capabilities of XFC-based controls. These capabilities include support for `LinkItem`, `BlobContent`, `CodedValue`, and several fundamental `Event` and `Guard` types. `LinkItems` contain the address of internal (DEF-based) or external (network-based) resources for support display or functionality in a DEF. `BlobContent` contains inline Binary Large Objects of virtually any type, but primarily those defined as standard MIME types.  Events are DEF user actions that are “captured” by the DEF to alter DEF behavior or functionality in some way.  The standard events are `Enter`, `Exit`, `OnEvent` (designer-defined).  `OnEvent` is a generic event that is defined by the form designer. An SDC Guard is a unit of coded functionality that is activated or “fired” by an Event somewhere else in the DEF. The two built-in Guards are `ActivateIf` and `DeActivateIf`. These Guards activate and deactivate visible XFC-derived DEF controls based on activity somewhere else in the DEF.  "

    "### FDF Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Each FDF has its own `ID` attribute in the `FormDesign` element, which uniquely identifies each “class” of FDF document. The word “class” is meant to convey that the `lineage` and `version` are identical for each FDF that shares an `ID`; The XML content is identical in FDFs that share an `ID`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, every XFC in an FDF contains an `ID` value, which must be unique within its FDF. However, `ID` values do not need to be globally unique. Therefore, the same `ID` values may be used in other forms, including: Forms with the same `lineage` and forms form a different source. Within a given organization, it is best to control the release of `IDs`, so that the same `ID` never appears in a different FDF `lineage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most XFC `IDs` are not changed when an FDF from a given `lineage` is released with a new `version`. However, a new FDF `version` will force an `ID` change for the `FormDesign` element. Within a given `lineage` of FDFs, identical XFC `ID` values signal that the semantics and basic structure of the object remains unchanged across different `versions`. The criteria for changing `IDs` on versioned Q and LI items are discussed later in this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to create a system for globally unique `ID` values that would enable every FDF and every XFC in a form to be uniquely identified, e.g., by using GUIDs. However, the use and maintenance of long GUID `ID` values can sometimes cause difficulties and errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "To enable the use of simpler, shorter `ID` values that are easier to use, the SDC Schema includes the `baseURI` attribute. The `baseURI` functions similarly to an XML namespace since it uniquely identifies the organization or group or even the current form. When the `baseURI` value is used in conjunction with the `ID` value, a composite globally-unique identifier (CGUI) is created for each XFC. For example, if the simple `ID` value is \"100\", and the `baseURI` is \"www.cap.org/FormsDomainSDC1/\", then the CGUI is \"www.cap.org/FormsDomainSDC1/100\", which the issuing organization (cap.org) should guarantee as unique within an FDF `lineage`. The CGUI is generated as needed and thus is not found explicitly in the FDF XML. Note that the `ID` value “100” need not be globally unique, but the CGUI should be globally unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default XFC `baseURI` is defined as identical to the `FormDesign` `baseURI`. A new `baseURI` is not assigned to an XFC unless the `FormDesign` `baseURI` is not “appropriate” for a specific XFC and its descendant XFCs. An appropriate `baseURI` should reflect the organization that created and/or maintains the XFC content, as well as the FDF content domain that it addresses. The `baseURI` is inherited by all descendant XFCs and should not be added to the SDC XML unless there is a change in `baseURI`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the `baseURI` is assigned once at the highest level of an FDF (the `FormDesign` element). Every descendant `ID` then inherits the `baseURI`, without repeating the `baseURI` at each XFC. If necessary, multiple `baseURIs` may be used throughout an FDF; these override any higher-level URI assigned above it in the FDF hierarchy. Thus, an XFC uses the `baseURI` ancestor that is closest to it in the FDF hierarchy, starting with its own `baseURI` value (if it is present).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a `baseURI`, the institution that creates an SDC form should have one or more registered globally-unique `IDs` (e.g., domain names or GUIDs) that are used to uniquely identify the origin and uniqueness of its SDC forms. Ideally, these `IDs` should be in URL format, and should ideally represent real URLs that can be \"dereferenced\" to provide information about the organization and its forms. It’s best to avoid using prefixes like “http://” or “https://” in the `baseURI` text because these add unnecessary length and can occasionally cause XML validation errors when used in a URI-typed field such as `formInstanceURI`.\n",

The formatting of any SDC element, such as `DisplayedItem` or `Section`, can be specified by the `styleClass` attribute.\n",

    "As described above, `DisplayedType`, which provides the `DisplayedItem (DI)` definition, is the parent Schema Type of the `XFC Types` for `S`, `Q`, `LI`, and `BA`. Thus, `S`, `Q`, `LI`, and `BA` inherit all elements and attributes of `DisplayedType`. `IF` does not inherit from `DisplayedType`, as it relies on the display properties of the subsumed injected parts, which do inherit from `DisplayedType`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary function of `DI` is to provide text in the DEF. Often this takes the form of \"notes,\" which are strings of text that may accompany `QAS controls` to provide explanatory information with background documentation. Although DEF notes usually derive from the `DI XFC`, they can also derive from other `SDC objects` such as Section titles and Property values. The `DI` (as well as all `DisplayedType descendants`) can additionally be used to display Links (e.g., to Internet resources), BlobContent (Binary Large Objects) of any MIME type, Contact information, and CodedValues.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Missing title values in a Question results in the creation of “invisible Questions,” where ListItems are visible, but the parent Question text is not. Blank title text is used to unclutter the DEF when the meaning of “sub-answers” is obvious from the context, and Questions title text would be distracting.  However, several some implementers have requested that the FDF suggest alternative text that reflects what the Question text could be, if it were displayed in the DEF. Therefore, the FDF files supply can these inferred terms as a Property with propName = “altText” for invisible Questions.  However, the altText Property values may have a deleterious effect when the DEF authors have decided that Questions title text is best omitted.  Importantly, altText Property values are not necessarily appropriate for use in synoptic report output.  In general, reportText Property values should be used to customize report output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, the `altText` Property value merely replicates the title value from the parent Question, because the parent Question text continues to be appropriate for the child ListItems.\n",

    "The `altText` Property value for the invisible Questions can be found as a Property under the invisible Question. Implementers should check with their end-users to determine whether they wish to use the supplied altText Property value, substitute their own appropriate text, or suppress the DEF Question text entirely. \n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that `altText` Property values be used only for internal purposes (e.g., as a guide to the visual identification of Questions in database queries) and not be displayed as visible text in the DEF unless approved by the end-users.\n"

The type of CR is determined based on the presence of a “?” prefix on ListItem title values, as described below.  “?” prefixes should never be displayed in SDC reports.

The ability to answer these conditional Questions depends on the responses to other Questions, and/or on information not explicitly present in DEF.  The XFC Question metadata to describe OWU consists of: `mustImplement = “true”` and `minCard = ”0”`. This means that an OWU Question must be displayed on the DEF, and it must be answered if it is applicable according to the specified condition (e.g., “if known”). However, this is a judgment that can only be made by the DEF-user.  This is demonstrated on Question 2 in the above figure.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Omit When Selected (OWS)\n",

    "Even when omitted from the report, OWS responses must nevertheless be validated normally by the DEF software and their responses should be saved in the eCP data store (e.g., EHR database), as with any other answered Question. Storage of the non-reported data may be needed for several purposes such as quality or medico-legal review.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the “?” display model is used for OWS, the Question and all OWS-flagged ListItems have the “?” prefix in the @title attribute.  The “?” on the OWS-flagged ListItem is simply a convenient visual flag for `omitWhenSelected=”true”` in the SDC XML, and it informs the DEF-user that, if the OWS ListItem is selected, the QAS will be omitted from the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report-generator must recognize the omitWhenSelected metadata, and, by default, omit the appropriate sections from the pathology report.  The report generator must also allow users to override the OWS default behavior if desired, thereby displaying OWS Questions and ListItems in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike OWU Questions, OWS Questions must be answered, even if they are omitted from the report. Thus, unanswered OWS Questions should be flagged by the DEF validation mechanism to unobtrusively warn the user. However, not answering an OWS Question should not affect accreditation status. This is because accreditation reviewers look at reports, not at the stored answers - Thus, from the report alone, it is not always possible to tell the difference between an unanswered OWS Question, and one that was answered but properly omitted from the report. The limitations of OWS are recognized by the DEF authors, but this validation and reporting technique is an intentional approach to producing less verbose reports.\n"

Questions that require an explicit Unanswered (Null) choice (as distinct from false) should preferably be reformulated as a Single-Select (i.e., combo box) type of Question, with mutually exclusive choices such as Present/Absent/Unknown/Cannot be Determined.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Locked QAS \n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally, a QAS may need to be locked, disallowing any editing of its ListItems or response values by the end user.  This technique is used in conjunction with the provision of default values, such as selected = ”true” on LIs, or default responses inside a QR ResponseField or the `ListItemResponseField` on a LI. The locked status is expressed by setting the Question’s  readOnly value to “true”. A locked QAS block is often included in an FDF, e.g., to represent a body structure or specimen that is always present, by definition, for a particular type of template. These items are included in the FDF to facilitate searching of the stored data.  \n",
    "The locked, non-editable, information may be optionally displayed on the DEF, but end-users frequently prefer that locked items are hidden. If it is displayed, it should not be represented in the form of a selectable control (e.g., combo box).  To facilitate a consistent approach to querying on common data elements, the locked information should be stored in the SDC data store (e.g., database), along with the other Question/Answer pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most locked Questions will have the value of `mustImplement = true`, but with minCard=0 and a reportText Property value of “{No text}”. In the following example, title value is empty, and the altText Property value contains the hidden Question text.  This approach is used because in general, locked items are not intended to appear in the DEF or report. In rare cases, a locked element may be an essential piece of information that MUST display in the report. In these circumstances, the associated metadata will dictate the desired use and output. Form designers may also use custom Properties to embed required information into FDFs.\n",

The parent Question of the unselected SDAC ListItem is also omitted from the report, because unanswered Questions are never reported. If the SDAC ListItem is selected, the report text of the SDAC ListItem and its parent Question’s title is controlled by the title value and reportText Property value, as usual. The activated descendant items of the unselected SDAC ListItem should appear in the report according to the usual reporting rules described for each item type."

To manage the manipulation of ID attributes, The FF/DEF contains an integer counter function. The integer counter # starts at 0, and is increased by one every time a new repeated component block is added by the user, anywhere in the XFC/DEF. The XFC suffix begins with **two** underscores (__) followed by the shared counter integer (#) that identifies the repeated component block in the FDF. The __# suffix is added to every XFC in the repeated block."
